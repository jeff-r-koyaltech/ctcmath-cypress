# Overview
If you have a CTC Math account and are teaching an entire class, and it's time to do grades, you might find this handy. This allows you to download the detailed report of each student with an automated testing tool called Cypress.

# Usage
I wrote this in a hurry (less than 1 hour) just to get it working. There's a test for pulling a student's report under their own credentials. There's another test for pulling the reports for multiple students as a teacher. You just have to supply some CSS selectors for those students, and credentials in creds.json.

Files go to the cypress/downloads folder.
